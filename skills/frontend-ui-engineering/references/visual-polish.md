# Visual polish and feedback states

Load when the component exists and the question is whether it looks and behaves like
production work. Three neighbouring skills own the rest: `design-tokens` for the palette,
type scale and theming; `responsive-layout` for sizing and breakpoints;
`accessibility-audit` for verifying the result.

## Avoid the AI aesthetic

AI-generated UI has recognizable patterns. Avoid all of them:

| AI Default | Why It Is a Problem | Production Quality |
|---|---|---|
| Purple/indigo everything | Models default to visually "safe" palettes, making every app look identical | Use the project's actual color palette |
| Excessive gradients | Gradients add visual noise and clash with most design systems | Flat or subtle gradients matching the design system |
| Rounded everything (rounded-2xl) | Maximum rounding signals "friendly" but ignores the hierarchy of corner radii in real designs | Consistent border-radius from the design system |
| Generic hero sections | Template-driven layout with no connection to the actual content or user need | Content-first layouts |
| Lorem ipsum-style copy | Placeholder text hides layout problems that real content reveals (length, wrapping, overflow) | Realistic placeholder content |
| Oversized padding everywhere | Equal generous padding destroys visual hierarchy and wastes screen space | Consistent spacing scale |
| Stock card grids | Uniform grids are a layout shortcut that ignores information priority and scanning patterns | Purpose-driven layouts |
| Shadow-heavy design | Layered shadows add depth that competes with content and slows rendering on low-end devices | Subtle or no shadows unless the design system specifies |

## Loading and transitions

```tsx
function TaskListSkeleton() {
  return (
    <div className="space-y-3" aria-busy="true" aria-label="Loading tasks">
      {Array.from({ length: 3 }).map((_, i) => (
        <div key={i} className="h-12 bg-muted animate-pulse rounded" />
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}

function useToggleTask() {
  const queryClient = useQueryClient();

  return useMutation({
    mutationFn: toggleTask,
    onMutate: async (taskId) => {
      await queryClient.cancelQueries({ queryKey: ['tasks'] });
      const previous = queryClient.getQueryData(['tasks']);

      queryClient.setQueryData(['tasks'], (old: Task[]) =>
        old.map(t => t.id === taskId ? { ...t, done: !t.done } : t)
      );

      return { previous };
    },
    onError: (_err, _taskId, context) => {
      queryClient.setQueryData(['tasks'], context?.previous);
    },
  });
}
```

Skeleton loading for content, not spinners. Optimistic updates for perceived speed; roll back on error.

## Common rationalizations

| Rationalization | Reality |
|---|---|
| "Accessibility is a nice-to-have" | It's a legal requirement in many jurisdictions and an engineering quality standard. |
| "We'll make it responsive later" | Retrofitting responsive design is 3x harder than building it from the start. |
| "The design isn't final, so I'll skip styling" | Use the design system defaults. Unstyled UI creates a broken first impression for reviewers. |
| "This is just a prototype" | Prototypes become production code. Build the foundation right. |
| "The AI aesthetic is fine for now" | It signals low quality. Use the project's actual design system from the start. |
